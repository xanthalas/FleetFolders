FleetFolders ReadMe
-------------------

FleetFolders is a small Windows utility which displays a list of folders and allows you to open any of them in Windows Explorer with a single keypress.

I wrote it because I spend a lot of time opening and closing Explorer windows every day. I don't like to have lots of windows open so when I am finished with a folder window I close it. Later when I need it again I have to use the Run dialog to find and open the desired folder again. Although Windows will remember previously opened folders and pre-fill the Run box it is still a cumbersome process. FleetFolders makes it ridiculously easy.

FleetFolders is written in C# using WPF and is compiled against .Net framework 4. 

To hack on it you will need the following:

   .Net framework 4
   Visual Studio 2010
